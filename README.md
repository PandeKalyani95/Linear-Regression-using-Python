Simple Linear Regression ML Project in Python

Regression analysis is a statistical technique that attempts to explore and model the relationship between two or more variables. 
	
simple linear regression
•	Simple linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between two quantitative variables. 
•	How strong the relationship is between two variables.
•	The value of the dependent variable at a certain value of the independent variable (e.g. the amount of soil erosion at a certain level of rainfall).

Assumptions of simple linear regression
•	Linear relationship between X and y.
•	Normal distribution of error terms.
•	Independence of error terms.
•	Constant variance of error terms.
